## üõ† Installation  

To get started with the development environment, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asha-saini06/relay-chat-app.git
cd relay-chat-app
npm install
```

### Backend Setup & Environment Variables

Before running the app, you need to configure the backend by setting up the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file:

1. **`MONGODB_URI`**: The connection string to your MongoDB database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
2. **`PORT`**: The port on which the server will run (default is `5000`).
3. **`JWT_SECRET`**: A secret key used for JWT authentication to ensure security in token generation and verification.
4. **`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`**: Your Cloudinary cloud name for media file uploads.
5. **`CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`**: The API key provided by Cloudinary for authentication.
6. **`CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`**: The API secret used by Cloudinary for secure file upload requests.


#### Example `.env` file:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/your-database-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your-very-secure-secret-key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual credentials and settings. Once the environment variables are set up, you're ready to proceed with running the backend server.

### Running the Development Server  

To run the app locally, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
